## Rust Webserver

In progress - a side project to learn the the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. It's a simple Heroku app built using the [Iron](http://ironframework.io/doc/iron/) framework, based on this [example](https://github.com/defyrlt/heroku-rust-cargo-hello). The idea is to POST a query string to the server, then return a JSON object to the browser.
